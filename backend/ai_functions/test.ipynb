This handy gadget lets you point, click, and drag things around your screen, making it a super important tool for navigating the digital world. But here's a fun fact: the very first computer mouse, invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964, was actually a bulky wooden box with metal wheels! It was nicknamed 'mouse' simply because the cord sticking out the back looked like a tail.\"\n",

      "    \"explanation\": \"Ever wondered how your mouse knows where you're moving it? It's not magic, it's physics! Most mice today are 'optical', meaning they use light to track movement. Inside your mouse, there's a small Light Emitting Diode (LED), often red, that shines a beam of light onto the surface below. A tiny camera, called a CMOS sensor, takes thousands of pictures of this illuminated surface every second. A small processor inside the mouse then compares these pictures. If the texture or pattern in the new picture has shifted to the left, the mouse tells your computer, 'Hey, we're moving left!' and your cursor follows. It does this incredibly fast, which is why the cursor's movement appears perfectly smooth to you.\"\n",
