Analyze the image and identify the main subject.

You MUST respond with a single, clean JSON object with two keys:
1. "object_label": The most common and specific name for the object (e.g., "Computer Mouse", "Field Mouse").
2. "category_hint": A single, lowercase word for the object's general category (e.g., "technology", "animal", "food", "plant", "place").

Do not add any other text outside the JSON structure.
